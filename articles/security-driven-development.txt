# Security-Driven Development

Tools for consideration:

- Static application security testing (SAST)
  - Commercial: Fortify, AppScan, Checkmarx
  - Open Source: FindSecBugs, Brakeman, PMD
- Dynamic application security testing (DAST)
  - Commercial: WebInspect, Burp, AppSpider
  - Open Source: ZAP
- Interactive application security testing (IAST)
  - Commercial: Contrast, Seeker

DevSecOps tools:

- FindBugs
- ZAP
- sqlmap
- OpenVAS
- Recon-ng
- OWASP Glue

Libraries which integrate into the CI/CD pipleine in a similar way to TDD tools

- Retire.js - detect use of version with known vulnerabilities.

Automated security testing
- Arachni
- Nikto
- ZAP

Builds

- Keep builds under 5 minutes, including all security tests, or split into parallel builds (fast, slow, nightly)

CI/CD pipeline

- Travis CI
- Jenkins
- (just need to support docker containers)
  - gruyere
  - gauntlt
  - cucumber

JavaScript library
- pentest-tool-lite
- dirW4lker.js
